- ✅ Google Sign-In provider enabled
- ✅ Authorized domains configured (localhost for development)
- ✅ Firestore database rules configured for user data

## File Structure:

```
frontend/src/
├── services/
│   └── firebase.js          # Google Auth integration
├── pages/
│   ├── LoginSignup.jsx      # Google Sign-In UI
│   └── Profile.jsx          # Google user profile handling
└── components/
    └── TranslatedText.jsx   # Multilingual support
```

## User Flow:

1. User clicks "Continue with Google"
2. Google OAuth popup opens
3. User authenticates with Google
4. App creates Firestore user profile automatically
5. User redirected to Profile page
6. Google data (name, email) pre-populated in profile form
7. User can complete additional health information

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing email/password authentication while providing a seamless Google Sign-In experience.
