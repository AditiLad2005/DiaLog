# Improved Diabetes-Safe Meal Prediction System

This document describes the major improvements implemented to fix the model issues and enhance prediction accuracy.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Portion-Aware Feature Engineering** ✅

**Problem**: The original model saw per-serving nutritional values regardless of actual portion size. "10 bowls of gajar ka halwa" had the same features as "1 bowl".

**Solution**: Runtime computation of portion-adjusted features:
```python
# Now computed at prediction time, not stored in CSV
portion_multiplier = portion_size_g / serving_size_g
carbs_effective_g = carbs_g × portion_multiplier
sugar_effective_g = sugar_g × portion_multiplier  
GL_portion = (carbs_effective_g × glycemic_index) / 100
calories_effective_kcal = calories_kcal × portion_multiplier

# Nutritional quality ratios
fiber_to_carb_ratio = fiber_g / max(1, carbs_g)
protein_to_carb_ratio = protein_g / max(1, carbs_g)
energy_density = calories_kcal / serving_size_g
```

### 2. **Hard Guardrails System** ✅

**Problem**: Model could be overconfident and miss dangerous combinations.

**Solution**: Deterministic medical rules that override model predictions:

```python
# Rule 1: Avoid-for-diabetic foods
if avoid_for_diabetic == 'Yes':
    if portion_multiplier ≥ 1.0 → UNSAFE
    if portion_multiplier < 1.0 and GL_portion ≥ 10 → UNSAFE
    else → CAUTION

# Rule 2: Portion sanity  
if portion_multiplier ≥ 3.0 → UNSAFE (no matter what)

# Rule 3: Sugar load thresholds
if sugar_effective_g ≥ 40g → UNSAFE
if 25-39g → CAUTION

# Rule 4: Glycemic Load (per portion)
if GL_portion ≥ 20 → UNSAFE
if 11-19 → CAUTION  
if ≤ 10 → OK (subject to other checks)

# Rule 5: Extreme calories
if calories_effective_kcal ≥ 800 → UNSAFE
if 600-799 → CAUTION
```

### 3. **Improved Model Training** ✅

**Previous Issues**:
- No user grouping (data leakage)
- Poor probability calibration
- Binary 0.5 threshold
- Focus on accuracy instead of safety

**New Approach**:
```python
# Stratified Group K-Fold (prevents user leakage)
cv = StratifiedGroupKFold(n_splits=5, groups=user_ids)

# Calibrated classifier for better probabilities
model = CalibratedClassifierCV(base_estimator, method='isotonic')

# Optimized for unsafe recall (catching dangerous meals)
scoring = ['accuracy', 'roc_auc', 'precision', 'recall']
# Target: unsafe_recall ≥ 0.9 even if precision drops

# Dynamic thresholding based on validation performance
threshold = find_threshold_for_target_recall(target=0.9)
```

### 4. **Decision Logic with Explanations** ✅

**New Decision Flow**:
```python
if any_UNSAFE_rule_triggers():
    return UNSAFE  # Hard override
elif any_CAUTION_rule_triggers():
    if model_very_confident_safe(prob > 0.9):
        return SAFE  # Model can override caution
    else:
        return CAUTION
else:
    return model_prediction  # Trust model for normal cases
```

**Explanation Generation**:
```python
# Every prediction includes human-readable reasoning
"Plain cream cake: Large portion (1.5×), GL=22 (>20), marked UNSAFE."
"Hot tea: Normal portion (1.0×), GL=1, low sugar (3g) → model SAFE (92%)."
```

## 🧪 Acceptance Tests

The system passes these critical test cases:

| Test Case | Meal | Portion | Expected | Actual | ✓ |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|---------|---|
| High GI, small portion | White rice | 0.5× | CAUTION/SAFE | ✓ | ✅ |
| High GI, large portion | White rice | 2.0× | UNSAFE | ✓ | ✅ |
| Avoid-for-diabetic | Cream cake | 1.0× | UNSAFE | ✓ | ✅ |
| Extreme portion | Any food | 3.0×+ | UNSAFE | ✓ | ✅ |
| High fiber | Vegetables | 2.0× | SAFE | ✓ | ✅ |

## 🚀 How to Use the Improved System

### 1. Setup and Training
```bash
# Run the complete setup
python setup_improved_model.py

# Or manually:
python train_improved_model.py    # Train new model
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload  # Start server
```

### 2. Test the Improvements
```bash
# Test guardrails system
curl http://localhost:8000/test-guardrails

# See sample predictions  
curl http://localhost:8000/predict-sample

# Make a prediction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "age": 45, "gender": "Male", "weight_kg": 75, "height_cm": 175,
    "fasting_sugar": 110, "post_meal_sugar": 140,
    "meal_taken": "Plain cream cake", 
    "portion_size": 2.0, "portion_unit": "cup",
    "time_of_day": "Snack"
  }'
```

### 3. Expected Response Format
```json
{
  "is_safe": false,
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "risk_level": "high",
  "message": "Plain cream cake: Large portion (2.0×), GL=35 (>20), avoid-for-diabetic at normal+ portion → marked UNSAFE.",
  "bmi": 24.5,
  "nutritional_info": {
    "calories": 471.0,
    "carbs_g": 88.4,
    "protein_g": 12.4,
    "fat_g": 54.0,
    "fiber_g": 1.4
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {"name": "Avoid This Meal", "reason": "Multiple risk factors detected."},
    {"name": "Reduce Portion Size", "reason": "Current portion is 2.0× normal. Try 0.5× instead."}
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

### ✅ **Solves the "10 Bowls Problem"**
```python
# Before: Same features for any portion size  
# After: Proper portion scaling
result = predict_meal_safety("gajar ka halwa", 1000g, user_data)
# → "Very large portion (10×), GL=315 (>>20), sugar=300g (>>40g) → UNSAFE"
```

### ✅ **Medical Safety First**
- Hard rules based on diabetes management guidelines
- Can't be overridden by model confidence
- Conservative thresholds for safety

### ✅ **Better User Trust**
- Clear explanations for every decision
- Shows which factors triggered the decision
- Transparency in reasoning process

### ✅ **Robust Validation**
- Group-based CV prevents overfitting to users
- Focus on catching dangerous meals (recall)
- Realistic test cases validate behavior

- Better portion awareness
- Medical safety guardrails  
- Improved explanations
- More reliable predictions

## 🎉 Result

The system now correctly handles edge cases like "10 bowls of dessert" while maintaining accuracy for normal meals. Medical safety is prioritized over model confidence, and users get clear explanations for every prediction.
